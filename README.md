### Hi there, I'm Ebram Raafat Thabet 👋

I am a Computer Science student at **The American University in Cairo (AUC)** (Exp. Dec 2026) with a concentration in **Artificial Intelligence** and minors in **Math & Economics**.

I bridge the gap between complex theory and practical application. Outside of building systems, I run the tech channel **[Be Tech Bo](YOUR_YOUTUBE_LINK_HERE)**, where I have taught **OS fundamentals, NLP, and AR** to over 4,000 subscribers.
