### Hi there, I'm Ebram Raafat Thabet 👋

[cite_start]I am a Computer Science student at **The American University in Cairo (AUC)** (Exp. Dec 2026) with a concentration in **Artificial Intelligence** and minors in **Math & Economics**[cite: 4, 5].

I bridge the gap between complex theory and practical application. [cite_start]Outside of building systems, I run the tech channel **[Be Tech Bo](LINK_TO_CHANNEL)**, where I have taught **OS fundamentals, NLP, and AR** to over 4,000 subscribers[cite: 8, 10, 12].
